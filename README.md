# DOWNTIME MONITORE

Maintenance Downtime Management System

Overview:
As a proficient developer, I conceptualized and developed a robust desktop application using C# Windows Form and SQL Server to address the specific needs of downtime management for maintenance technicians within the company. This Maintenance Downtime Management System encompasses three distinct user profiles, catering to the diverse roles within the organization.

User Profiles:

Producer Profile:

The producer, often the individual working directly with the machinery, uses a user-friendly interface to report detected issues. They input crucial information such as the machine's location and a brief description of the problem.
Technician Profile:

Technicians access the system to view reported issues, select problems to resolve, and document detailed information upon completion. The application efficiently manages intervention start and end times.
Coordinator/Admin Profile:

Coordinators or administrators have comprehensive control over the system. They can manage all data, search using various criteria, and access statistical key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) presented in intuitive graphs. Additionally, coordinators can export data to Excel sheets based on selected dates.
Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive interfaces for producers to report issues and for technicians to manage and resolve them.
Time Management: Efficiently tracks intervention start and end times for accurate downtime analysis.
Statistical Insights: Provides coordinators/admins with KPIs and graphical representations of critical maintenance metrics.
Data Export: Enables the export of data to Excel sheets, enhancing data analysis capabilities.
Technologies Used:
The application was developed using C# Windows Form for a user-friendly interface and SQL Server for robust data management.

Role:
As the developer, I played a pivotal role in designing and implementing the Maintenance Downtime Management System. This involved creating user interfaces, integrating database functionality, and ensuring a seamless experience for all user profiles.

Challenges Overcome:
Overcoming challenges included ensuring real-time data synchronization between producers, technicians, and coordinators, as well as implementing an effective time management system for interventions.

Outcome:
The Maintenance Downtime Management System is a testament to effective collaboration and problem resolution within the organization. It offers a streamlined process for reporting, resolving, and analyzing downtime incidents.
